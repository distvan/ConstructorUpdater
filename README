The Perl class is help to replace your old style php constructor calling and its references.

Usage:
perl -I <path to ConstructorUpdater.pm> start.pl <from search path>

If you don't add the first argument to the calling the default is the current directory.
It searches the php files recursively and replace the actual code elements.
